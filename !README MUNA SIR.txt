>> Sir good day, or night? I don't know what time you're running this, but...
>> Run this project preferabbly on Brave. If you don't have Brave, try Chrome. This step is important
>> Click "index.html" for default landing page.
>> I used bootstrap for this particular project that's why the class names are kind of messy.
>> I am not an expert on javascript, all these js files are all reverse engineered, if an idea comes
to my mind, i google it and implement it. To be honest I don't really know how I wrote these JS's, I just
copied every steps made by those indian youtubers I followed. But hey, as long as the output from my thoughts came up fine. Or was it?
>> To provide you a little peace of my despair, this project is my 6th attempt, I tried making my own
css files/library but making it responsive is really tough! This time I used bootstrap and watched bunch of
tutorials to make this project possible. This is not the process that I really want, but since I'm running
out of time because of... you know, new year, christimas eve and stuff.
>> Hope you like it sir!
